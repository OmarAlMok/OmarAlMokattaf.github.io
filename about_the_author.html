									<h3 class="major">About the Author</h3>
									<p>Hi! I’m Omar Elmekataf, a Mechatronics Engineering student with a passion for blending creativity, logic, and technology. </p>

									<p> My background in engineering has fueled my curiosity for how things move, think, and interact—whether it’s a robot, a machine, or a line of code. Central City is a project born from that same curiosity. It combines storytelling, problem-solving, and interactive design to create an immersive experience where players must think critically, solve riddles, and navigate through a living maze.</p>

									<p> The Online Library was also born out of that same curiosity and passion for software developing. How customer/server relationship worked and functioned has always been an interest of mine, and putting it into practice has expanded my horizons. </p>

									<p>  Through these projects, I explored the intersection of engineering and art—applying my technical skills in programming, systems thinking, and design to bring a world of imagination to life. My goal is to keep learning, building, and creating experiences that challenge both the mind and the heart.</p>

									<p> Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I hope you enjoy experiencing the worlds I’ve created as much as I enjoyed building them!</p>
